Library Database Analysis

📚 Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive Library Management System using a relational SQL database to efficiently manage, track, and analyze library resources, borrower activities, and book circulation. The system is designed to improve operational efficiency and support data-driven decision-making for library management.

🎯 Objectives

•	Automate and streamline library operations

•	Track book availability, loans, and due dates

•	Generate insights on popular books and active borrowers

•	Improve accuracy and save time in library management

🗃️ Database Schema

The database includes the following tables
•	Publisher – Stores publisher details

•	Book – Contains book information and links to publishers

•	Book Authors – Manages author information and book-author relationships

•	Library Branch – Stores branch locations and details

•	Book Copies – Tracks copies of books across different branches

•	Borrower – Maintains borrower information

•	Book Loans – Records all book lending transactions

📊 Key Features & SQL Queries

•	The system supports various analytical queries including:

•	Most Borrowed Books – Identifies popular titles

•	Book Availability – Tracks copies across branches

•	Borrower Activity – Finds active/inactive borrowers

•	Branch Performance – Analyzes lending activity by branch

•	Author-Specific Queries – Filters books by specific authors

🛠️ Technologies Used

•	SQL – For database design and querying

•	Relational Database – Structured data management

•	Data Analysis – Generating operational insights

📈 Insights & Recommendations

•	Based on the analysis, key recommendations include:

•	Optimize Book Availability – Add more copies of high-demand books

•	Boost Borrower Engagement – Implement reminder systems and campaigns

•	Improve Branch Performance – Allocate resources based on activity levels

✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates that a well-designed SQL database is fundamental to modernizing library management. By automating the tracking of books, loans, and borrowers, the system increases operational efficiency, reduces errors, and provides valuable data-driven insights. These insights enable libraries to optimize their resources, improve user engagement, and make smarter, more informed decisions for future growth.
