Library Database Analysis
📚 Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive Library Management System using a relational SQL database to efficiently manage, track, and analyze library resources, borrower activities, and book circulation. The system is designed to improve operational efficiency and support data-driven decision-making for library management.

🎯 Objectives
Automate and streamline library operations

Track book availability, loans, and due dates

Generate insights on popular books and active borrowers

Improve accuracy and save time in library management

🗃️ Database Schema
The database includes the following tables:

Publisher – Stores publisher details

Book – Contains book information and links to publishers

Book Authors – Manages author information and book-author relationships

Library Branch – Stores branch locations and details

Book Copies – Tracks copies of books across different branches

Borrower – Maintains borrower information

Book Loans – Records all book lending transactions

📊 Key Features & SQL Queries
The system supports various analytical queries including:

Most Borrowed Books – Identifies popular titles

Book Availability – Tracks copies across branches

Borrower Activity – Finds active/inactive borrowers

Branch Performance – Analyzes lending activity by branch

Author-Specific Queries – Filters books by specific authors

🛠️ Technologies Used
SQL – For database design and querying

Relational Database – Structured data management

Data Analysis – Generating operational insights

📈 Insights & Recommendations
Based on the analysis, key recommendations include:

Optimize Book Availability – Add more copies of high-demand books

Boost Borrower Engagement – Implement reminder systems and campaigns

Improve Branch Performance – Allocate resources based on activity levels

✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates that a well-designed SQL database is fundamental to modernizing library management. By automating the tracking of books, loans, and borrowers, the system increases operational efficiency, reduces errors, and provides valuable data-driven insights. These insights enable libraries to optimize their resources, improve user engagement, and make smarter, more informed decisions for future growth.
